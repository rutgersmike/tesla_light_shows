# tesla_light_shows
A collection of xLights sequences I've created that sync music and Tesla Model 3 lights

## How to run the light show
1. Download an entire folder, e.g. [Tom Devil](./Tom_Devil)
2. Purchase the exact song by the exact artist listed or linked in that folder, renaming it "lightshow.mp3" or "lightshow.wav" depending upon the file type
3. Copy everything into a folder titled 'LightShow' in the root directory of a USB drive
4. Ensure the USB drive doesn't have Tesla software updates or a 'TeslaCam' folder
5. Insert the USB drive into your Tesla and wait ~15 seconds
6. Open the ToyBox and click Light Show
7. Click Start the Show, get out of your car, and annoy your neighbors!
